# Gym Application (WIP)
### The perfect application to schedule workouts, keep a log of your progress and much more!

I've encountered a simple issue at the last couple of gymnasiums that I've been to. None of them have some type of application to keep track of what exercises I should be doing this week/month, or with how much weight I did my exercises the last time I did them and how I felt with that weight. I have to remember all those things!

Obviously, this is not a big issue to normal people but, for me, as a programmer and Engineering enthusiast, it's a pretty big deal. I found something that could be simplified and I have to do something about it.

### Future Features
- List all possible gymnasium exercises.
- Being able to add how many repetitions and series you have to do in each exercise.
- Being able to determine different exercises per day.
- Being able to add what wheight was used the last time.
- Automatically show the exercises of the day as soon as you open the app.
- Support user accounts and customization with authentication.
- Let users determine the frequency and preferred scheduling of their workouts.
- More...
